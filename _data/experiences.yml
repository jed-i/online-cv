  details: "Since the Bincrafters was formed, I have been both the manager, and one of
  the top three package contributors. This involves creating, reviewing, and maintaining Conan.io 
  recipes which are written in Python, and which build open-source C++ libraries into packages.  
  It also involves configuring and managing the devops pipeline including Appveyor and Travis CI 
  systems which to execute the recipes, and the public Conan repository on Bintray.com.
